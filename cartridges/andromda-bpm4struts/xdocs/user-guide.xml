        <section name="Abstract">
            <p class="abstract">
                This page is a user guide to the bpm4struts cartridge, here you will find information on specific
                modeling features. If you are looking for a place describing what you need to do with your
                UML tool in order to model an application for bpm4struts you should read on.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Model elements">
            <p class="std">
                With model elements we mean the collection of all those elements that allow us to express ourselves
                and formally describe process flow. We will use these elements to model our Struts application.
                What follows is a list of elements and a description on how they map onto Struts specific objects.
            </p>
            <h3>Classes</h3>
            <p class="std">
                In bpm4struts classes are only used to model controllers, a controller is the component that
                contains the logic to perform business operations. Most of the time, in J2EE applications, you
                will want to delegate your call from the controller to a service running in the back-end.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                A class is assigned to be the context of an activity graph and it contains operations that are
                referenced by CallEvents. A CallEvent is an event that you can model in the activity graph but
                that allows you to create a link with the controller class. You will see what this means in
                more detail when taking a look at the sample application.
            </p>
            <h3>Actors</h3>
            <p class="std">
                An actor represents a user in the system, typically you will model an actor for each different
                type of user that exists in your application, this might be a 'Manager', 'Administrator',
                'Guest', etc...
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Actors may generalize eachother, making it possible to combine several roles into a single one.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Modeling actors will activate security in the generated application, an actor is only
                authorized to request those pages and actions belonging to the use-case he has been associated with.
            </p>
            <h3>Use-Cases</h3>
            <p class="std">
                Each unit of processing logic is combined into a single use-case. Typical use-cases are: 'Login',
                'Place order', 'Add new user'. No two use-cases should have the same name.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Put your use-case in a dedicated namespace (such as a package in Java) so there is no confusion
                on what is supposed to be happening inside.
            </p>
            <h3>Activity Graphs</h3>
            <p class="std">
                Each use-case is described in more detail using an activity graph. Such a graph allows you to
                model the process flow from one state into another. By doing so you will determine when the
                user is presented a page and when he will be calling actions.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                In an activity graph you will model: one initial state, action states, one or
                more final states, transitions.
            </p>
            <h3>Transitions</h3>
            <p class="std">
                Transitions are the 'arrows' that denote a flow from the source state to the target state.
                Every state in an activity graph has at least one outgoing transition, except for the final state,
                no outgoing transitions are allowed on a final state.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Optionally a transition may carry a trigger, a trigger indicates that something happened at the
                source that triggered the application into following the path represented by the transition.
                In bpm4struts you will use a trigger when you want to model an action such as a button-click
                on a page, because this will trigger a specific call to an action on the server.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                In addition, triggers are also interesting because they can have parameters, so each time the
                client and server exchange information you will want to use the trigger to specify the parameter
                to transport in the request.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                It is also possible for a transition to carry a guard, but this is only valid when the transition
                is coming out of a decision point (see below). The decision point represent a specific question
                such as 'is this a new user ?' and the guards represent possible answers to that question.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Sometimes you will want to specify the application should handle specific exceptions,
                you can do this also using transitions. More specifically by putting them on an action state
                and targetting a page. Such transitions should be tagged with the FrontEndException stereotype.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                To make it easier for the modeller using bpm4struts we implemented the convention that in case
                no exception handler is specified a default one will be implied. This means that if an action
                throws a java.lang.Exception it will be handled and the message will be forwarded to the
                page which triggered the action, so you will simply return back to the page. This default
                exception handler will not be implied if there is at least one exception handler
                explicitely specified.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                For bpm4struts you must make sure that all transitions coming out of an initial state or an action
                state marked with the FrontEndView stereotype must be marked with the FrontEndEvent stereotype.
                This will tell the cartridge to treat what follows as the logic that is executed in a single
                action on the server.
            </p>
            <h3>Initial States</h3>
            <p class="std">
                Only a single initial state is allowed per activity graph, for bpm4struts it is enough for it to be
                there, you do not need to give it a name, but you may.
            </p>
            <h3>Action States</h3>
            <p class="std">
                An action state is an atomic state of the application's use-case, you typically have many
                of them in a single use-case.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                A special type of action state is the one that has been marked using the FrontEndView
                stereotype, because this will tell the cartridge to render a JSP page by analyzing the
                context in which the action state is used.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                All other action states will be considered to be living on the server. Optionally those ones
                may carry deferrable events, these events can call the operations from the controller class. The
                cartridge will render methods for these calls into the actions.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
            <h3>Final State</h3>
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                A final state in an activity graph represents the end of the use-case. Because a typical web
                application not simply stops showing pages you will need to indicate to which use-case to go next.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                You can do that by using the name of the use-case (which is unique in the scope of the application)
                and entering it as the name of the final state. The cartridge will pick it
                up and make the necessary links.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
            <h3>Swimlanes</h3>
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                This feature is completely optional, but I recommend using it on your diagrams for clarity. Divide
                your activity graph into partitions using swimlanes, you will have one for
                the server and one for the client.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                This way you can immediately see where you are in the use-case but also in the
                implementation. See the samples for more details.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Action Types: Hyperlinks vs. Forms">
            <p class="std">
                In a typical web application one can distinguish two different types of actions: hyperlinks and
                buttons. The difference between them is that with buttons you may additionally have a form with
                input fields sent to the server. This means that the user can decide at run-time what will
                exactly be sent. Hyperlinks are static in the sense that they cannot be changed by the
                client through the page.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                This distinction can be specified by bpm4struts also, and depending on the parameters that
                are being sent to the server more hyperlinks will be rendered.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                In short, for each action parameter tagged as a 'select' parameter (and thus having a
                list to back it up) the cartridge will loop of the backinglist, all other parameters are
                sent as they are found.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Example: you have a list of items and you want a link for each item in the list, simply
                create an action parameter 'item' and tag it as 'select' (which will always create a list
                to backup the 'item'). If the action is a hyperlink action the JSP will be rendered as desired.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                To illustrate the difference, please take a look at the folowing images. They represent pages
                generated from exactly the same UML model, the only difference is that one of them contains
                an action that has been marked as being of type 'hyperlink' ... this will instruct the
                cartridge not to render input widget, but an hyperlink with parameters instead.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Field Types">
            <p class="std">
                If you wish to display input fields using a special widget you can do so using the
                @struts.view.field.type tagged value. Depending on that value the
                parameter will be treated differently.
            </p>
