                Modeling activity graphs allows you to clearly express the way your application flows from one
                state into another. This already helps a great deal in the code generation process, but all this
                effort only makes sense when you are actually able to insert your own code fragments
                into this process. UML elegantly allows this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Per use-case you will need to model a class in which you will put all the operations that can be
                called from within that use-case's activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will need to associate this class to the use-case somehow, the cartridge can't just guess which
                use-case it corresponds to. Therefore we have two options, depending on the maturity of the UML
                tool you are using:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assign this class as the context of the activity graph (MagicDraw supports this),
                        this is a standard UML feature that, unfortunately, is often overlooked by CASE tools vendors.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a tagged value to the controller, pointing to the use-case, like this:
                        <code>@andromda.presentation.controller.usecase=My UseCase</code> (the value is the name
                        of the use-case).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Either one of these options will do, we recommend using the former because that way you won't need
                to update the tagged value whenever you decide to change the name of the use-case (which can be a pain).
            </p>

            <subsection name="Operation parameters">
                <p>
                    So what exactly happens with the parameters you model inside the controller operations ? Well,
                    by specifying the name and type of a parameter you can gain access to an event parameter or
                    page-variable defined in another part of the application. Just make sure the name and type
                    perfectly match.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the next example you see how a controller operation is called before entering the
                    <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> action state. This operation has a single argument
                    <code>data : List</code> which exactly matches the page variable on the outgoing
                    transition. Doing this will allow you to control this page variables in the implementation
                    of the controller operation.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    Please note that it is possible your CASE tool is not showing the operation parameters
                    in the diagram, as in the image below.
                </p>

                    <img src="howto/org/andromda/test/deferring-param-ctrl.gif"/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only page-variables can be controlled like this, it would also work for any existing
                    event parameters (not shown in the image), as long as you include them as a controller operation
                    argument you will have access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What might look strange at first is the fact that you don't need a return value: don't forget
                    you are not modeling Java code, you're modeling the behavior of the state machine, so let the
                    cartridge determine the code to generate. Basically you just need to remember to include a
                    parameter for each form field you wish to use. (Return values are only needed when using controller
                    operations in a decision process as we have seen <a href="howto2.html#Decision_Points">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not needed to add tagged values on controller operation parameters, any tagged
                    values will be fetched from the actual page-variables or event parameters.

                Now that we know how to define custom code operations we need to learn how
                to call them from within your activity graph, <a href="howto4.html">read on</a>.
