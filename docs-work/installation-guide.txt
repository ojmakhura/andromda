The document provides an installation procedure for AndroMDA. It covers:
1.  building of AndroMDA project
2.  building of Sample application

Installation of AndroMDA
------------------------
Prerequisite
- [for the latest cvs version] CVS Client
- Apache ANT (http://ant.apache.org/)

Recompilation of AndroMDA is very simple three-step process:

1. Download source distribution or CVS Checkout
You may either download the latest source distribution, or checkout the source
from cvs. This section describes the procedure to checkout the from the cvs.

    1.1 Set CVSROOT environmental variable
        for windows:
        set CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/andromda
        for unix/linux:
        export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/andromda

    1.2 login
        cvs login
        (use a blank password)

    1.3 checkout
        cvs checkout andromda

For more information and help, refer to:
    http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=73047

//todo: consider to add new module for "java/src"

2. Configure build properties
After checked out all files, you'll see a directory named "andromda". The
directory structure is like: [insert screen shot]
The next step is to configure the build properties. AndroMDA is well-configured
by default and you should need to change only one or two properties at most.

	2.1 rename build.properties.sample to build.properties

	//todo: why not name it build.properties at the begining?!

 	2.2 modify build.properties
 		- thirdparty.home
 			Point it to your Apache ANT directory

    //todo: bundle ant.jar in our package
    //todo: add a build.bat and build.sh that set the bundled ant library to
            classpath and run "ant"

3. Run Ant
    It is as simple as typing "ant" at the command console.

	//todo: if users may call more than one task, make "ant" default to a help
	    manual, or display "please use 'ant -projecthelp'".

Running the Car Rental Sample
-----------------------------
It is highly recommend for you to run the provided car rental sample to make
sure your AndroMDA is configured properly. It is also an easy task. Procedure is
as follows:

1. Go to andromda/src/sample/car-rental-system

2. Configure build properties
	2.1 rename build.properties.sample to build.properties

	2.2 modify build.properties
		- andromda.home
			e.g.    c:/andromda/  or
			        /usr/andromda/ (notice the slash at the end)
		- thirdparty.home
		    Point it to your Apache ANT directory

		- j2ee.libs
		    In case you don't use JBoss/EJB, you may still run the sample.
		    Please download j2ee library from Sun Microsystems or other sources.
		    (http://java.sun.com/j2ee/download.html) And configure j2ee.libs
		    accordingly

		    //todo: add a parameter in Ant to disable the deploy/copy to JBoss

	2.3 copy andromda.jar to the andromda.home
	//todo: check this
	//todo: use **/*.jar in Ant classpath definition. Drawback: slower

3. Run Ant
    It is as simple as typing "ant" at the command console.
