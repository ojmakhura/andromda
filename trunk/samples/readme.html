        The samples illustrate the use of AndroMDA with Maven.  
        Both the Animal Quiz and Car Rental System show typical
        AndroMDA project structures. 
        <p>
            Provided in this
            distribution is a maven plugin, you can use this
            plugin to generate your own application having the 
            same structure as these samples.  To run it, just install
            the plugin into your $MAVEN_HOME/plugins directory (copy the
            file maven-andromdapp-plugin-[VERSION-NAME].jar).  
            In the directory where you would like your project directory
            created enter 'maven andromdapp:generate'.  
        </p>
        <p>
            It's also possible to build an Ant based project with AndroMDA by 
            using the &#60;andromda&#62;. ant task (although its currently not shown in the
            samples).
        </p>
        <p>
            The following instructions assume you are familiar with operating
            a JBoss system.
        </p>
        <p>
            To build the samples, perform the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Install the latest version of <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>
                    and add it to your $PATH or %PATH%
                </li>
                <li>
                    From this directory (the directory in which this file you're reading is located) type 'maven'; 
                    this will build all samples.  After the build has completed successfully,
                    follow the instructions for each sample below.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>   
        NOTE: After you've built the samples the first time, you can build them again 
              with the '-o' parameter passed to maven.  (i.e. you can
              type 'maven -o').  The '-o' tells Maven to build offline and since
              it isn't trying to download the dependencies, it will build much faster.
        </p>
