                        The Xdoclet dependency, WebDoclet to be exact, has been removed from the bpm4struts-cartridge;
                        now the <code>struts-config.xml</code> and <code>validation.xml</code> files are generated
                        directly by AndroMDA. The Ant-tool and the maven plugins, used to generate a default AndroMDA
                        project, have also been updated to reflect this change.

                        auto-detect the appropriate value. In addition more validation constraints
                        have been added to inform the user of any cartridge modeling errors.

                        The latest major bpm4struts update did not prove to be a very elegant solution,
                        this led us to revise
                        the implementation and come up with an alternative one. Here's a list of what has changed:
                        <ol>
                            <li>parameters with the same name and in the same use-case are required to also
                                be of the same type</li>
                            <li>form fields do no longer have their name prefixed with the name of the action</li>
                            <li>forms now implement an interface for each controller operation they defer to</li>
                            <li>it is now needed to put arguments in the controller operations, these arguments
                                will be available in the form interface that is accessible programmatically</li>
                            <li>these arguments will need to have the <code>
                                @andromda.struts.view.field.type</code> tagged value set to 'select' in case
                                you want to prepopulate a list of entries (see samples)</li>
                            <li>currently it is also needed to specify the table columns (just as you
                                would on a collection-type page variable) in case the argument
                                maps onto an action parameter which is displayed in tabular format, but this
                                will be solved soon</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="highlight">
                            All of this means this will break the compilation of your current

                        With this change, multiple new namespace properties were added 
                        for configuring this configuration file.

                        <code>@andromda.struts.action.warning.message</code> to the action
                        transition and set its value to the message you want to have displayed (will be i18n'ed).
                        Warning messages will be rendered in yellowish.
                        In addition all messages are now supported on <strong>any</strong> transition, and you may have
                        more than one message on such a transition (unlimited).

                        This change fixes some issues with the most recent updates for bpm4struts:
                        <ol>
                            <li>We no longer have the controller operation interfaces the forms were implementing</li>
                            <li>Instead we have a controller operation for each different action that defers to them,
                                this means you sometimes have the same operation more than once with only a different
                                argument type for the form. This seems to be the most optimal and realistic
                                implementation, forms cannot be shared using interfaces aggregating the fields
                                because field names carry the action name as a prefix and this cannot be changed
                                because in that case validation rules would be impossible to determine for fields
                                that have the same name and type over different page actions.
                            </li>

                        the 'Impl' suffix. This has been done for consistency with other cartridges
                        and because it is cleaner not to have any suffix on the interface or
                        abstract parents.

                        The form containing such a parameter will have two new properties:
                        'valueList' and 'labelList'. If you do not specify the 'labelList'
                        property it will assume the values of the 'valueList'.
                        The backing list has been made readonly
                        because it will construct a special array to be handled by the Struts tags.

                        of several different types implementing this interface can be passed in.
                        This elegantly allows a single controller operation to be called from different
                        actions (which each have their own form).

                    <td valign="top" class="std">
                        A major change has been incorporated into the cartridge, you will have to
                        be very careful when migrating to a version after this date.
                        ActionForms are back into the request scope so their properties will not be
                        persisted into the session as was the case before. Bpm4Struts now is
                        intelligent enough to determine which properties should be available in which
                        ActionForm (even in ambiguous cases such as cyclic processes or when
                        multiple actions target multiple pages without a 1-to-1 mapping.
                        The reason for this drastic change was a possible bug in the server-side
                        validation framework. It would happen that forms were not properly recognized on
                        the server while the client could parse them fine.
                        In order to properly migrate you should at least need to fix the controller
                        implementations (you will have compilation errors otherwise), unfortunately
                        you will need to update all JSP pages. The changes are minimal so you might
                        consider looking at the differences manually (we are back at using the Struts HTML
                        tag library instead of the plain old HTML tags directly).
