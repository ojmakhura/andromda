            <p>
                A few guides have been written to make it easier to get started using AndroMDA
                on your projects, on this page you will find the links to those guides.

                        Explains how to set up a new project template in which you use AndroMDA to generate
                        code from your UML model. The project templates have been specifically designed
                        for J2EE applications.

                        Bpm4Struts is a cartridge that is able to generate Struts code from activity
                        graphs and use-cases. This guide briefly explains the way you should approach
                        and eventually model your application's architecture. This is a one-page
                        how-to featuring screenshots.

                        The Spring cartridge is used to generate your application's back end, it generates Spring services
                        (optionally wrapped by Session EJBs) using Hibernate POJOs for persistence.
                        This guide includes seven pages of documentation including screenshots and examples of 
                        generate code.  The spring-cartridge's features are listed and described.
