      <h1>How to install AndroMDA</h1>

        <b>Download, unzip, CLASSPATH!</b><br />
        (or was it "Ready ... steady ... go!" ?)

      <p class="std">
        The installation of AndroMDA itself is quite easy (the real challenge
        will come later!).
      </p>
      <p class="std">
        Download the distribution files  from
        the
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73047">
          AndroMDA file list
        </a>
        on SourceForge's web site and unzip them into the same directory of your choice.
        You will notice that there are quite a number of them and that they all have
        a release number at the end of the filename:

        Unzip the files you need into a directory of your choice. Be prepared to
        insert jar files from these directories onto the classpath of your
        build.properties script (see instructions later in this text). AndroMDA will auto-detect
        a cartridge if its main jar file (e.g. andromda-hibernate.jar) is on
        the classpath when AndroMDA is run.

        <b>Other software that you will need</b>

      <p class="std">
        AndroMDA is based upon some other software components that
        you will need to download from the Internet and include in
        the CLASSPATH of your build script. These components
        are:
        <ul>
          <li class="std">
            <code>Ant</code> - the famous build tool, made by the Apache Jakarta project.
            You can download it from
            <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">
              the Apache Ant website
            </a>
            . Unpack ant into a directory of your choice and set the property
            <code>myant.home</code> in your file <code>build.properties</code>
            before you run your personal Ant build script.
          </li>
          <li class="std">
            <code>JBoss</code> - a very popular open source application server.
            You can download it from
            <a href="http://www.jboss.org/">
              the JBoss website
            </a>
            . Unpack it into a directory and set the property <code>jboss.home</code>
            in your <code>build.properties</code> before you run your ant build scripts.

      <p>
         XDoclet is a code generation engine. It enables Attribute-Oriented 
         Programming for java. In short, this means that you can add more significance 
         to your code by adding meta data (attributes) to your java sources. 
         This is done in special JavaDoc tags.
