        <section name="The Sample Application - TimeTracker">

            <p>
                The AndroMDA tutorial uses a sample application to explain how to use AndroMDA.
                This application is called TimeTracker. Before we dive into the design and implementation
                of TimeTracker, we need to understand the business problem it is trying to solve.
            </p>

            <p>
                Northwind Corporation uses a paper based system to track the time of their employees.
                This process is highly inefficient and hence the CIO of Northwind has tasked you
                to create an online time tracking system called TimeTracker. Unfortunately, he wants
                the system delivered by next week and if you can't meet this deadline he will give
                away the job to someone else. Suddenly you remember a conversation with your friend
                the other day where he was raving about how AndroMDA can generate large portions
                of an application from business level specifications. You say to yourself "If this
                is really true, it will help me meet my deadline. Let's give AndroMDA a try." So
                you accept the CIO's offer and get to work.

                Your first stop is at the office of the Director of Human Resources. You ask her
                to describe the current time tracking process. She says "At the beginning of every
                week, each person picks up a new timecard from the supply room. As they work on
                different tasks, they record their start and stop times on this timecard. Every
                task has a task id which they look up from the employee handbook. At the end of
                the week people submit their timecards to their managers for approval. A manager
                can either approve or reject the timecard. If rejected, they must put a comment
                on the timecard stating the reason for rejection. The submitter of the timecard
                must then make necessary corrections and resubmit the timecard for approval." You
                politely ask the director for a copy of a typical timecard. Here's what she gives
                you.
