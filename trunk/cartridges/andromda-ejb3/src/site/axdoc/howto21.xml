            <p>
                The EJB3 cartridge now has the ability to enable your EJB 3.0 components as Seam components.
                This latest addition is work in progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the initial roadmap for JBoss Seam integration from the forum.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
                Remember: You must set the 
                <a href="namespace.html#persistenceProviderExtensions">persistenceProviderExtensions</a>
                namespace property such that Hibernate validator specific annotations are generated.

            <subsection name="Seam Roadmap">
                <p>
					1. Have a new profile called andromda-profile-seam, as part of the andromdaplugins project 
					containing all stereotypes and tagged values pertaining to seam components. Projects need to download 
					and build the artifact and manually load the profile module within their UML model.
				</p>
				<p>
					2. Every entity or session bean which is to be modelled as a Seam component should have an 
					extra <![CDATA[<<Seam>>]]> stereotype.
				</p>
				<p>
					3. #2 will render the @Name stereotype with the value taken as the class name. Should 
					provide <code>@andromda.seam.component.name</code> tagged value to override this.
				</p>
				<p>
					4. Provide <code>@andromda.seam.component.scope</code> with enumerated values to set the scope if 
					required, otherwise use defaults.
				</p>
				<p>
					5. @NotNull on getters is rendered based on attribute multiplicity.
				</p>
				<p>
					6. @Length annotation's max property is taken from 
					<code>@andromda.persistence.column.length</code> tagged value. To specify a min 
					length, set the tagged value to x,y where x is min, y is max. 
					Need to account for this in the facade logic impl.
				</p>
				<p>
					7. @In and @Out annotations for bijection are rendered on attributes defined on 
					session bean class where <![CDATA[<<In>>]]> and <![CDATA[<<Out>>]]> stereotypes are
					modelled respectively. If attribute multiplicity is 0, 0..1, 0..*, define 
					require property in both annotations. If attribute multiplicity is 1, 1..* 
					define create property on @In.
				</p>
				<p>
					8. @Create annotation rendered on session bean operation if a 
					<![CDATA[<<Create>>]]> stereotype is modelled on it.
				</p>
				<p>
					9. @Destroy annotation is rendered on a session bean operation if a 
					<![CDATA[<<Destroy>>]]> stereotype is modelled on it.
				</p>
				<p>
					10. Provide tag <code>@andromda.seam.validation.invalid.outcome</code> with enumerated 
					list of values to be set on session bean operations (to render @IfInvalid) such that 
					Hibernate Validator can validate component state before invoking action listener 
					session bean operation (for components with @Valid annotations). 
					<code>@andromda.seam.validation.invalid.refreshEntities</code> can be set to true or 
					false and if defined, adds the refreshEntities property to the annotation.
				</p>
				<p>
					11. <![CDATA[<<Valid>>]]> stereotype can be modelled on session bean attributes 
					to render @Valid annotation for validation (see #10).
				</p>
				<p>
					12. Modify andromdapp project generator to ask a further question:
					Would you like to use the JBoss Seam application framework?
					Only if persistence engine is ejb3, a web interface is required and interface type 
					is JSF. This will add the jboss-seam artifact as dependency to necessary poms 
					and include it in the ear for deployment. Perhaps include a property called 
					seamEnabled in the andromda.xml application descriptor in the default namespace.
				</p>
				<p>
					13. If seamEnabled (# 12), ejb-jar.xml contains necessary interceptor binding 
					and application.xml contains the jboss-seam.jar java module definition.
				</p>
				<p>
					14. As soon as you introduce session bean attributes, the cartridge assumes 
					the bean is a stateful session bean. One solution would be to remove this 
					default so that the only way to specify a session bean as a sfsb 
					is via tagged value <code>@andromda.service.type</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					15. Stereotype <![CDATA[<<DataModel>>]]> can be modelled on attributes 
					(of type java.util.List - but I don't think this can be enforced). 
					This will render @DataModel on the attribute. An optional tagged value 
					<code>@andromda.seam.datatable.datamodel.name</code> can be modelled on such 
					attributes to defined the context variable name if more than 1 datamodel exists.
				</p>
				<p>
					16. Stereotype <![CDATA[<<DataModelSelection>>]]> can be modelled on attributes 
					to inject the selected value from the DataModel into this attribute. This 
					will render @DataModelSelection on the attribute. An optional tagged value 
					<code>@andromda.seam.datatable.datamodel.selection.name</code> can define the 
					name of the context variable defined by the appropriate @DataModel.
				</p>
				<p>
					17. Stereotype <![CDATA[<<Factory>>]]> can be modelled on session bean 
					component operations with <code>@andromda.seam.component.factory.context.name</code>
					which is modelled on the operation to set the context variable name.
				</p>
				<p>
					18. Stereotype <![CDATA[<<RequestParameter>>]]> can be modelled on session bean 
					component attribute to indicate an attribute is to be injected with the value 
					of a request parameter. Optional tagged value 
					<![CDATA[@andromda.seam.component.requestParameter.name]]> will define the 
					request parameter name.
				</p>
				<p>
					19. Tagged value <code>@andromda.seam.transaction.rollback.outcome</code> on session 
					bean component operation, can have multiple values to indicate that transaction 
					set for rollback on the specified outcomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					20. Not sure if we really need to touch the Java cartridge. If we can add a new
					stereotype to define a class/metafacade as a JavaBean in the EJB3 cartridge 
					and apply the Seam component model to it, it would avoid bloating the 'simple' Java cartridge.
				</p>
				<p>
					21. Tagged value <code>@andromda.seam.component.conversational.ifNotBegunOutcome</code>
					if set will render the ifNotBegunOutcome property of the @Conversational annotation 
					to indicate the JSF outcome for the action if no long-running conversation is 
					active when the component is invoked.
				</p>
				<p>
					22. Stereotype <![CDATA[<<Begin>>]]> can be modelled on session bean component operations 
					to indicate a long-running conversation started, which will render a @Begin annotation 
					on the operation. Should define extra tagged values for ifOutcome, join, nested and 
					pageflow properties of @Begin annotation.
				</p>
				<p>
					23. Stereotype <![CDATA[<<End>>]]> can be modelled on session bean component operations 
					to indicate the end of a long running conversation. Define tagged values for ifOutcome 
					and evenIfException properties.
				</p>
				<p>
					24. Define similar stereotypes/tags for jBPM tasks/processes.
				</p>
				<p>
					25. Stereotype <![CDATA[<<Unwrap>>]]> modelled on attributes but is rendered 
					on getter method of beans.
				</p>
				<p>
					26. Everything needs to have XDOC documentation.

                <p>
                    The AndroMDApp project generator from <code>3.2-SNAPSHOT</code> in CVS onwards supports JBoss Seam 
                    for EJB3 and JSF for web project only.  As long as you select these components, all the necessary
                    JBoss Seam properties will be enabled in your project.

                <p>
                    There exists a separate Seam profile that needs to be imported into your project.  This profile
                    contains the Seam specific tags and stereotypes you need to model on your components.  You can
                    get this profile by if you have checked out the latest <i>andromda-plugins</i> project from 
                    <b>HEAD</b> (follow <a href="installation.html">Installation</a>) and build the
                    <b>Profiles</b> project.  Once this is done, the profile will be copied to your M2 repository
                    under <i>M2_REPO/org/andromda/plugins/profiles/uml14/andromda-plugins-profile-seam/VERSION/</i>.
                    You can then import this <i>andromda-plugins-profile-seam-VERSION.zml.zip</i> profile into your
                    model to utilise the Seam components.
