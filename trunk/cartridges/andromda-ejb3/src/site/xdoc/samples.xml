                To help understand the EJB3 cartridge, the following sample applications have been provided.
                All these samples are located in the <i>andromda-plugins</i> project on SF.net.

	                This sample application is located in the <code>samples/demo-ejb3</code> directory of the
	                <code>andromda-plugins</code> project on SourceForge.net.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	                The project has the same structure as described in
	                <a href="http://docs.andromda.org/samples.html">AndroMDA Samples</a>.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	                This sample demo illustrates the use of the EJB3 cartridge (EJB 3.0 functionality), 
	                manageable entities and web services.  It is built for the MySQL database engine using
	                JBoss 4.0.4 GA or newer.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	                Simply build the demo by executing <code>mvn</code> in the root of the project directory.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	                Once you have build the sample, you need to create the database called <code>demo-ejb3</code>.
	                You can then deploy the following to JBoss.
                </p>
	                <ul>
	                    <li>demo-ejb3/app/target/demo-ejb3-ds.xml</li>
	                    <li>demo-ejb3/app/target/demo-ejb3-mq-destinations-service.xml</li>
	                    <li>demo-ejb3/app/target/demo-ejb3-1.0-SNAPSHOT.ear</li>
	                </ul>
	            <p>
	                The demo also contains simple clients that you can alter and execute to better understand 
	                the functionality in each demo sub-package.

	                This booking system tries to replicate the JBoss Booking System (available from JBoss)
                    to illustrate the JBoss Seam features.  It also relies on the EJB3 cartridge. 
	                It is built for the MySQL database engine using JBoss 4.0.5 GA or newer.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	                Simply build the demo by executing <code>mvn</code> in the root of the project directory.

	                Once you have build the sample, you need to create the database called <code>booking-seam</code>.

	            <p>
	                This example does not contain any view components at this time.  As JBoss Seam functionality
                    improves, this project will serve as a complete example for both EJB 3.0 Seam components and
                    JSF with Facelets view components.
