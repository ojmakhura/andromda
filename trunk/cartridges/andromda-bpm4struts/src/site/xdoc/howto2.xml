        <section name="Activity Graphs">
            <p>
               These graphs allow you to express the way you want your application to behave, this is expressed
               by means of states and transitions. An activity graph therefore is, by definition, a
               <em>state machine</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your activity graph should be modeled as a child element of the use-case. In case your modeling
                tool does not support that you can add a tagged value to the use-case, making it point to the
                activity graph, like this: <code>@andromda.presentation.usecase.activity=My Activity Graph</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                On this page you will see how to use the different states, and how to express the flow from one
                state into another.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
                Custom code (methods) can be executed from an action state, you will learn about that in
                <a href="howto4.html">one of the later sections</a>.
            </p>
            <subsection name="Initial States">
                <p>
                    Each use-case needs an <code>initial state</code>, an initial state is displayed as
                    a solid black disc. It denotes the starting point of the use-case, it can have no incoming
                    transitions and only one outgoing transition. Only a single initial state is allowed
                    per activity graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since our example features only one use-case it will therefore
                    contain exactly one initial state.
                </p>

            <subsection name="Action States">
                <p>
                    An action state represents a certain state in which the application can be recorded,
                    an action state is displayed as a rectangle with rounded corners. In bpm4struts you will
                    use action states for both server-side states (the controller: struts actions)
                    as client-side states (the view: JSP, VTL, ...).
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    Make sure the actual name property of each action state is unique in the activity graph.
                    Additionally, make sure the name is properly entered: sometimes people enter the action state's
                    <em>label</em> in the activity diagram instead of the real name of the element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Client-side action states are tagged with the <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> stereotype,
                    they represent a JSP and may have multiple outgoing transitions (one per call
                    to the server).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Server-side action states do not need any stereotype but can only have a single outgoing
                    transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="howto/org/andromda/test/action-states.gif"/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the time you'll want exactly a single outgoing transition for your server-side
                    action states, but in a few cases it is required to take full control of the process flow, meaning
                    you don't want to have the application forward to the next resource. In this case simply don't
                    model an outgoing transition, the Struts action class will return <code>null</code>. Don't forget
                    to write to the HTTP response yourself, you can do this is you defer to a controller operation in
                    your action state.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    You'll want to make use of this feature when you want
                    an action returning a dynamically generated report such as a PDF.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Transitions">
                <p>
                    Transitions are used to interconnect the different states in the activity graph, they make up
                    the actual process logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few tagged values exist for transitions coming out of <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> action states,
                    please see this page to learn more about them:
                    <a href="profile.html#Tagged_Values">profile.html</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using these tagged values a transition may be marked to carry a message to the (indirectly)
                    targetted <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> action state:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>@andromda.struts.action.success.message</code>: Write a message that will be
                            displayed in a green box. This message will be stored into the default
                            resource bundle.</li>
                        <li><code>@andromda.struts.action.warning.message</code>: Write a message that will be
                            displayed in a yellow box. This message will be stored into the default
                            resource bundle.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is possible to model exceptions to the process logic, in doing so you express how the system
                    should behave in case something goes wrong. You just need to add the
                    <![CDATA[<<FrontEndException>>]]> stereotype to the transition and you're good. Additionally
                    you can add a tagged value to such a transition in order to refine the exception handling:
                    <code>@andromda.struts.exception.type</code> needs the fully qualified classname of the exception
                    to be handled by this transition, others will be ignored; the default value if not specified is
                    <code>java.lang.Exception</code> meaning all exceptions will be handled.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    The default exception handling strategy is to return to the source page on which
                    the exception has been triggered.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Event Parameters">
                <p>
                    Event parameters are parameters modeled on transitions exiting client-side action states
                    (the ones with the <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> stereotype). Whenever you model such a transition
                    it represents a call to the server from a webpage, usually by submitting a form. The parameters
                    you model will represent the form fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that you will need to add the parameters to the transition's <code>trigger</code>,
                    this trigger should be of type 'signal', but don't worry about that if your UML tool does
                    not support setting the type of the trigger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="howto/org/andromda/test/event-parameters.gif"/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Different tagged values exist to control the generation of the type of the event parameter.
                </p>
                <div class="indented">
                    <table>

                            <strong>Selectable parameters</strong>
                        </td></tr>
                        <tr><td>
                            <p>
                                Event parameters can be made selectable so that the user can select one or more values
                                from a list and send them to the server. In order to achieve this we need to make the
                                distinction between two types of data: the complete list and the selected value(s).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The event parameter you model should represent the one that is sent to the server,
                                this typically is a String but could also be a Collection, List, int, etc...
                                Add the following tagged value to this parameter:
                                <code>@andromda.presentation.web.view.field.type=select</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p class="highlight">
                                A collection-type parameter (Collection, List, Set, ...) will result in the rendering
                                of a list where multiple selections are possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Adding this tagged value will allow us to populate this list prior to showing it to
                                the user.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Any action that is entering the page on which this parameter is an event parameter
                                will have the possiblity to populate the list. In order to do this you would simply
                                defer to a controller operation which has as argument a parameter with the exact same
                                name and type as the event parameter, defer to this operation somewhere <em>before</em>
                                entering the <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> action state. This will result in
                                the controller having the possiblity to set the values and labels for the
                                selectable field.
<source language="java"><!--
public void preloadCounterList(ActionMapping mapping, PreloadCounterListForm form, ...
{
    Object[] values = {"1","2","3","4"};
    Object[] labels = {"one","two","three","four"};

    form.setNumberValueList(values);
    form.setNumberLabelList(labels);
}

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Notice how the <code>form</code> allows setting the values and labels to back up
                                the selectable event parameter. In this case the event parameter had been named
                                <code>'number'</code>. Most of the time the data that will go into the list is coming
                                from the back-end, in this example the list contents never change.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is another method available for selectable event parameters that is equivalent
                                to the above but is easier to use when the labels and values are encapsulated
                                in value objects:
<source language="java"><!--
public void preloadCounterList(ActionMapping mapping, PreloadCounterListForm form, ...
{
    // the next list contains value objects
    Collection numberValueObjects = getNumbers();

    // use the 'id' property as the value, and use the 'text' property as the label
    form.setNumberBackingList(numberValueObjects, "id", "text");
}
--></source>

                                Setting the labels is optional, in case they are missing the application will
                                assume the values instead.

                                one. By default 3 radiobuttons are rendered, but this number can be changed by using the
                                <code>@andromda.struts.view.field.radio</code> tagged value, which either takes
                                a positive integer value or a comma-separated list of values from which to select.

                                present on the form that is able to convert this index to the modeled selection value.

                <p>
                    Page variables are modeled the same way event parameters are, the only difference is that
                    you model them on transitions <em>entering</em> a <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> action state.
                    In doing so the modeled parameters will be available in the generated JSP page.

                <p>
                    Page variables can be rendered in tabular format, this is an advanced feature which
                    is explained in more depth on this page:
                    <a href="howto8.html">Tables</a>.

            <subsection name="Decision Points">
                <p>
                    In some cases action states and transitions just aren't enough, a good example is when you
                    want to fork the flow based on a specific decision. Suppose you want to follow the first
                    transition if the user login credentials are valid, and follow the second transition if they
                    are invalid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to do this we must need to be able to call an operation with a return value, on which
                    the decision is based. We will see how to do this later, click here
                    to proceed there now: <a href="howto4.html">Custom Code</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally we must tag the transition indicating when it must be followed, in UML this is done
                    by means of <em>guards</em>. Not to make things overly complex it is not necessary to model
                    the OCL for the guard (very few tools properly support this), so instead it will be sufficient
                    to model the name of the guard, it must match the return value of the method call
                    (matching is done using <code>String.valueOf(returnValue)</code>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some modeling tools do not properly show the name of the guard in the activity diagram, in that
                    case you might consider copying the name also in the guard's body, this will be ignored by the
                    cartridge and might show it on screen for clarity.
                </p>

            <subsection name="Final States">
                <p>
                    You may have as many final states as you want in an activity graph. In bpm4struts a final state
                    represents the end of the use-case and the flow into the next use-case. Final states are
                    displayed as bulls-eyes in activity diagrams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two ways of modeling a final state: either you give it the name of the next use-case
                    (which can be the same as the current use-case), either you do not name it and you use a hyperlink
                    to the next use-case (this is not supported in all UML tools).
                </p>

            <subsection name="Sending parameters across use-cases">
                <p>
                    Sometimes it can happen that you would like to send parameters from one use-case into another
                    use-case. This is easy with the bpm4struts cartridge: just model the parameters on an action
                    leading into a final state and the parameters will automagically be available in the target
                    use-case.

                </p>
                <p class="highlight">
                    Respect the fact that use-cases are supposed to be loosely coupled: do not assume incoming
                    parameters to always be present and check for <code>null</code>, this will improve your
                    application's robustness.

                    Each action state carrying the <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> stereotype will result in the generation
                    of a JSP page. If you have properly modeled your use-case then these pages will contain
                    already everything to have a working application: forms, buttons,
                    hyperlinks, a menu, breadcrumbs, an online help, client validation, server calls, security ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    The generated JSP pages comply to the JSP 2.0 specification, as found in J2EE 1.4.

            <subsection name="Struts Actions/Forms">
                <p>
                    For each transition modeled exiting either an initial state or an action state with the
                    <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> stereotype the cartridge will generate a Struts Action class
                    and a Struts Form class. The parameters modeled on the transition's signal event
                    will make up the fields that go into the form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The generated <code>struts-config.xml</code> descriptor will contain a <code>form-bean</code>
                    entry per generated Form. Here's an example:
<source language="xml"><![CDATA[
<form-beans>
    ...
    <form-bean
        name="purchaseItemsEnterUserDetailsPurchaseForm"
        type="my.onlinestore.purchase.EnterUserDetailsPurchaseForm" />
    ...
</form-beans>

                </p>
                <p>
                     Each action will have a corresponding
                    <code>action-mapping</code> entry, like this:
<source language="xml"><![CDATA[
<action-mappings>
    ...
    <action
        path="/PurchaseItems/EnterUserDetailsPurchase"
        type="my.onlinestore.purchase.EnterUserDetailsPurchase"

            redirect="false" />
    </action>
    ...
</action-mappings>

                </p>
                <p>
                    A Struts action class and associated form is generated per sequence of transitions between two
                    <![CDATA[<<FrontEndView>>]]> action states. The form fields are determined by the parameters
                    modeled on the transitions, for maximum usability some parameters from neighbouring actions
                    might also be included, but we'll not get into this just yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The action class has a <code>private</code> method for each different state it encounters, those
                    methods might delegate control to a controller operation, this is explained
                    <a href="howto3.html">here</a>. A code fragment taken from the online-store sample is shown below,
                    it contains a single action state deferring control to the <code>loadItems</code> controller
                    operation. Please notice exception handling is taken care of. Such methods start with an underscore
                    not to cause naming conflicts with existing Struts
