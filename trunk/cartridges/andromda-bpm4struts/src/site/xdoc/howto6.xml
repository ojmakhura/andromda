        <section name="Security">
            <p>
                Adding security to your web application can be done very easily, although in a coarse-grain fashion:
                you cannot tell the cartridge to allow a specific person access to some page, you would rather
                express which groups of people have permission to access a specific use-case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again UML elegantly allows us to model this: just associate actors to your use-cases. When an actor
                is associated to a use-case it means that all users represented by that actor are allowed to call
                that use-case's actions: hyperlinks will be enabled and the server will allow access to the
                resources in the use-case's package.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a user is not permitted access to a specific use-case he will find that the hyperlinks to that
                use-case are rendered in plain text, form buttons are grayed-out, and that the server will
                not authorize any access to the resources of that use-case.
            </p>
            <p>
                To facilitate the modeling of the user groups using actors, these actors are allowed to generalize
                other actors, thereby explicitely inheriting the privileges of the parent actor.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
                Use-cases without any actors associated to them will always be accessible, the application
                will authorize anyone who requests access to them.
            </p>
            <subsection name="Input validation">
                <p>
                    By default the cartridge generates client-side and server-side validation code. On the
                    client side this is implemented using Javascript, rendered dynamically into the JSP
                    pages by the <![CDATA[<html:javascript ... />]]> struts tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The server-side code is perfectly equivalent to the validation on the client-side. Client-side
                    validation is interesting because it can warn the user of errors without having to go to the server
                    (which can take time and resources), server-side validation is a safety net that will guarantee
                    input fields are present or properly formatted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Client-side and/or server-side validation can be enabled or disabled using the
                    <code>clientValidation</code> and <code>serverValidation</code>
                    <a href="namespace.html">namespace properties</a> respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Different types of validation exist and depending on how you model your application
                    different validation routines will be activated. For example, numeric input fields
                    will be checked, email addresses will be checked for valid format, URLs must be well-formed,
                    input needs to be in a certain range, creditcard numbers must pass the
                    <a href="http://www.beachnet.com/~hstiles/cardtype.html">Luhn</a> check, .. even regular expressions
                    can be matched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Check the table at the bottom of the <a href="profile.html">Profile</a> page to learn
                    what's possible. <em>Please note that more than one validator tagged value can be added to an
                    event parameter.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding your own validator is simple, you can specify the validator's name so it will be checked
                    if you just make sure your validator has been added to the <code>validator-rules.xml</code> file.
                    To do this make use of the <![CDATA[<!-- validator-rules merge-point -->]]>
                    <a href="../index.html#mergeMappingsUri">merge point</a>.

                <p>
                    If you have enabled security the <code>web.xml</code> descriptor will contain sections
                    describing the security on the level of each individual use-case, the use-case and actor
                    relationships shown in the diagram above would yield output like this:

                    Please note that you would usually not model the <code>Login</code> use-case, except in those
                    cases you need very specific functionality that cannot be handled easily using the default
                    JAAS framework.

                    A login page will always be generated automatically, but this time it will be presented
                    to you when you are trying to access one of the application's resources, this might be an action,
                    an image, a JSP or anything else which it will try to locate within the application's path.

                                    been enabled by default you can always access the login page by simply
                                    appending <code>/login/login-form.jsp</code> to the context-path, like
                                    this: <a href="http://team.andromda.org:8080/OnlineStore/login/login-form.jsp">
