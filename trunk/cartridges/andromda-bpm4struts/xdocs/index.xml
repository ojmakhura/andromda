                These pages describe the 'bpm4struts' cartridge. The shorthand 'bpm4struts' stands for
                'Business Process Modeling for Struts'. The purpose of this cartridge is to generate
                Struts web pages from an input UML model in which the flow of the application is modelled.
            </p>

        <section name="Introduction">
            <p class="std">
                Writing a web front-end for J2EE application can become a really cumbersome and tedious task.
                Most of the time it is very difficult to start with a good design and keep it,
                the problem may even become more apparent when multiple developers are working on the same
                project. In a Struts application more specifically, problems that often arise are: too
                much data in the session, bad variable names in the pages and in the actions,
                inconsistent programming style, improper exception handling, hard-coded constants,
                duplicated code, and the list goes on...
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                The reason these issues exist is not always because the developers are inexperienced
                or lazy; the main reason is that it is simply very difficult to keep everything
                consistently up-to-date. It is very easy to lose track of what is going on and before
                you know little evil parts of code find their way in, introducing bugs and making
                maintenance a pain.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                It is important to keep an eye on the big picture. Take a look at your application
                from a distance, maybe you'll spot some design flaws. This brings us to the most common
                tools for communicating application architectures: the Unified Modeling Language,
                unfortunately not many people believe in it ... and that's understandable, it can be
                quite a burden to keep the UML model up-to-date (*) when you are already facing the
                many issues mentioned above; the Model Driven Architecture paradigm solves this problem
                elegantly, read on.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                (*) This is already where it is going wrong, your model should exist before you even start coding,
                but since development is an iterative process and changes are often applied in the code first
                we find ourselves updating the UML model to comply with these changes.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                A second comment is that at all times a developer should spend his efforts on the core business
                of the application, if he's writing an online web-shopping application he should not be worrying
                about coding connection pooling or a search engine, this should be reused from elsewhere.
                There is so much activity in the open-source community that this should not be a problem anymore.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                So, if it would be possible to quickly generate the desired code from a UML model using
                coding templates, and to regenerate this code without losing any manually applied changes,
                one can easily see the benefits: a constant focus on the overall design, the developer can
                try several different approaches in a short time interval, the developer spends his time
                on the business logic and not on the technologies used to achieve his goals.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                As you will read in this document bpm4struts addresses the majority of these items.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Goal">
            <p class="std">
                We aim to have a means of generating a stable and flexible Struts front-end by modeling dynamic
                business processes from UML. The transformation from UML to Struts should be open enough to allow anybody
                to easily update this process, for example by simply editing some templates.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Any feature provided by Struts should also be available in the cartridge.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                The generated code should be consistent and in-line with the most common best-practices in web development.
                It must also help the user adding the final pieces of code in order to finish the implementation. Except
                for the business logic he will need to implement himself, the user should not need to have knowledge
                of the rest of the generated application, although it can never hurt.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Regeneration of code from UML should not overwrite manually written code. Classes can attain this
                goal by using a construction such as inheritance. With JSPs we use Tiles to isolate those pieces
                that need regeneration, anything else remains untouched.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                When a complete application has been modelled it should be possible to generate and
                deploy the application without any further changes to the code. The application should
                work right-away, this allows the user to test-drive and see if it is what he expected,
                optionally updating the model where necessary.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Requirements">
            <p class="std">
                Bpm4Struts uses the dynamic part of the UML model, more specifically activity graphs
                and use-cases. Your CASE tool should be able to set an activity graph context class, and
                it should be possible set the CallEvent of a trigger on a transition.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Currently bpm4struts has only been tested to work with MagicDraw 7, which requires
                a commercial licence, but support for free tools such as ArgoUML and Poseidon is underway.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                A knowledge of Struts with the Tiles and Validator plugin, CSS, JSP, MVC and Velocity is
                an advantage if you would like to customize the generation process.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Bpm4Struts uses JDK1.4+ and uses Struts 1.2 by default, at the time of this writing
                this version has not yet been released. Nevertheless, if you need a copy you can find
                a build here:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://team.andromda.org/maven/struts/jars/struts-1.2dev-SNAPSHOT.jar">struts-1.2dev-SNAPSHOT.jar</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://team.andromda.org/maven/struts/tlds/struts-bean-1.2dev-SNAPSHOT.tld">struts-bean-1.2dev-SNAPSHOT.tld</a></li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                In order to display tabular data we have chosen to use the 'displaytag' tag libary. This is an open source
                library that can be used in JSP pages.
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.displaytag.org">Examples</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://displaytag.sourceforge.net">Development pages</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://displaytag.sourceforge.net/tagreference-displaytag-12.html">Taglib reference</a></li>
                </ul>
                We are currently using 'displaytag-1.0b3' so you will need to have this dependency when building your
                web application with andromda-bpm4struts.
            </p>

        <section name="Features">
            <h3>Generation of the complete set of required Struts files</h3>
            <p class="std">
                From a UML model bpm4struts is used to generate a fully deployable web application.
                Complete with a security implementation, validation rules (client &amp; server),
                exception handling and page forwarding.
                These features are all available and easily updatable via the UML model.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                For this feature to work you will need to run XDoclet on the sources generated by this cartridge.
                The generated files include:
                <ul>
                    <li>struts-config.xml</li>
                    <li>jsp pages</li>
                    <li>action classes</li>
                    <li>form bean classes</li>
                    <li>resource message properties</li>
                    <li>web.xml</li>
                    <li>validation.xml</li>
                    <li>validator-rules.xml</li>
                    <li>javascript validation routines</li>
                    <li>a welcome file redirecting to the first use-case</li>
                    <li>tiles-defs.xml and a default implementation</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>I18n through message resource bundles</h3>
            <p class="std">
                Struts will automatically load the appropriate resource bundle for
                your localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n) settings whenever available.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Bpm4struts will generate a default resource bundle generated in the language used for modeling.
                In order to port this file to another language you will need to simply:
                <ul>
                    <li> copy it into the same directory, suffix the filename with something as "_fr", "_nl", "_de"
                        (see <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html">
                        java.util.ResourceBundle</a> for more details)</li>
                    <li> translate all the message values (leave the message keys untouched)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Role-based security</h3>
            <p class="std">
                For each user there will be a role, depending on the use-cases associated to that user
                he will gain the privileges to access that use-case's resources and call the
                corresponding actions.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Users can inherit roles from each other, a user that inherits from two other users
                will be assigned a role which has the accumulated privileges of the roles from both
                other users.
            </p>
            <h3>Client-side validation</h3>
            <p class="std">
                Per request sent by the client to the server it is possible to specify
                the validation rules for the included parameters. The appropriate Javascript
                functions will be rendered to handle this validation. This will avoid unneccessary
                calls to the server.
            </p>
            <h3>Server-side validation</h3>
            <p class="std">
                In case for some reason an invalid parameter format would arrive at the server the user
                will be returned to the page of origin with a message indicating what went wrong.
            </p>
            <h3>Customizable exception handling</h3>
            <p class="std">
                For each action it is possible to forward exceptions to a specific page. By default,
                however, all exceptions are forwarded to the page where the action call was triggered,
                a suitable message will be shown.
            </p>
            <h3>Consistent page layout</h3>
            <p class="std">
                Thanks to the combined use of tiles and CSS it is possible to abstract the style &amp;
                layout from the content of the pages. All pages will be rendered in a similar style, it will
                be sufficient to update or extend the existing style in order to customize the look
                and feel of the application.
            </p>
            <h3>Tabular resultsets</h3>
            <p class="std">
                A very common feature in web pages is the displaying of tabular data. Bbpm4struts directly supports
                this feature through the use of the 'displaytag' tag library. You will be able to have control
                over the following features:
                <ul>
                    <li>Paging: by default pages of 15 entries are rendered, this value can be changed</li>
                    <li>Exporting: the data can be exported to XML, CSV or Excel</li>
                    <li>Sorting: you will be able to sort any column you want</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Web development">
            <p class="std">
                When developing a web front-end you must be aware that it is nothing like your regular Swing/GUI
                development, such as in a standalone application. The HTTP protocol is stateless by design,
                while most users want to have the feeling they are in a session or context.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                There are many ways to solve these typical problems on the web front-end. Personally, I
                choose not to make use of the session in the web container: as much as possible is done purely
                in the scope of the requests. This has several advantages: bookmarks always work, the back
                button will not corrupt any session data, etc... This is important to know when modeling for
                the bpm4struts cartridge, it allows you to look at each use-case separately and treat them
                as individual processing units. You will also notice you tend to write better code this way.
            </p>
            <p class="std">
                Next, we need to consider the communication between the client and the server, what tools to
                we have at our disposal ? Well, quite enough I must say ... we can use almost any feature
                we can find in a rich standalone GUI client: radiobuttons, textareas, hyperlinks, tooltips,
                and so on. So it would be nice if we can render the appropriate input elements for the
                request parameters sent from the JSP page.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Struts">
            <p class="std">
                In order to adhere to the spirit of Struts web development I am trying to attain at least the same
                strict requirements of its MVC implementation. As opposed to earlier version of this cartridge,
                you will only need to model the Controller class, the Views and Models are implied by the dynamic processes.
            </p>
            <h3>Model</h3>
            <p class="std">
                The model corresponds to the form bean used in the request, this bean encapsulates all request
                parameters for the use-case. No more logic should be put it there. Models are generated by looking
                at the parameters sent between action states.
            </p>
            <h3>View</h3>
            <p class="std">
                In a Struts application you will use JSP pages to represent the view components. In the
                application's activity graphs views are tagged with the 'FrontEndView'' stereotype.
            </p>
            <h3>Controller</h3>
            <p class="std">
                A Controller class defines the business operations performed by the actions on the front-end. Typically
                it is the user who triggers an event by clicking on a button or an hyperlink, this event is handled
                by an action that will defer any business operation to the controller.
            </p>
