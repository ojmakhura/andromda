      <h1>The Look and Feel and How it Works</h1>
          <p class="std">
            AndroMDA for itself does not have a "look", the look begins when
            you start a CASE tool and draw the packages, classes, 
            attributes, methods and relationships. Later, you save
            your model in XMI format and let AndroMDA and XDoclet
            generate a whole bunch of Java files for your EJBs. Both tools
            are integrated into the well-known build tool "Ant".
            Usually, you invoke the command-line version of Ant,
            but you can also use Ant from an IDE like Eclipse or JBuilder.
            In any case, you use you own, personal Ant build script
            and call AndroMDA as one "custom task" from there.
          </p>
          <p class="std">
            <b>Modeling in UML with a CASE tool</b>
          </p>
          <p class="std">
            The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has a 
            graphical notation that allows you to model the world
            as you see it. An example: A car rental system might
            manage customers, drivers, cars and rental contracts.
            One class diagram from a UML model of this system might
            look like this:
          </p>
          <img src="images/CarRentalCustomers.gif" width="408" height="496" />
          <p class="std">
            Save the model to an XMI-formatted file. Some CASE tools will
            call this an "export", some will not, as it is their native
            file format.
          </p>
          <p class="std">
            <b>The generator</b>
          </p>
          <p class="std">
            From the model, the Ant script generates the Java files
            in these steps:
            <ul>
              <li class="news">
                The first step 
                takes the XMI-formatted output file of the CASE tool
                and converts it into a format that is easily readable
                by the AndroMDA Ant task. This format is also XML-based
                - I call it "SimpleOO".
              </li>
              <li class="news">
                Next, the Ant task reads the SimpleOO model and creates an
                in-memory object model from it that contains the packages, classes,
                attributes, methods and relationships.
              </li>
              <li class="news">
                Now, it starts the Velocity template processing
                engine and processes templates for entity beans,
                session beans and their implementation classes, 
                all based on the object model that it created from the
                transformed CASE tool output.
                As a result, several Java files are written, the
                most important of which are called *Bean.java,
                containing the bean classes.
              </li>
              <li class="news">
                Now, the Ant script calls the EJBDoclet task which is
                contained in XDoclet. This task reads all the bean classes
                and generates the bean's interfaces and deployment
                descriptor elements.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="std">
            <b>The output files</b>
          </p>
          <p class="std">
            From the customer part of the car rental system model above,
            AndroMDA and XDoclet will generate
            the following files for you. Bean classes are marked with
            <img src="../images/ejb.gif" align="middle" />,
            the other classes are marked with
            <img src="../images/class.gif" align="middle" />. You can
            click on a file name to see the contents of the file.

            <b>Writing the business methods</b>
          </p>
          <p class="std">
            Well, using the generator is not everything (as you will
            probably know). The beef of the beans, the business logic,
            is your job. AndroMDA built a framework for you to fill
            in your code. The so-called "implementation classes" derive
            from the bean classes and are the leaves of the class hierarchy.
            AndroMDA generates them only once and will never modify them again.
            This is to make sure that hand-written code will never be
            overwritten by the generator.
          </p>
          <p class="std">
            So, code your business methods inside the implementation classes
            and start the rest of your personal Ant build script that will
            compile all the Java files and put them into an ejb-jar file.
            The deployment descriptor has already been generated, so put it
            into the jar file, too.
          </p>
          <p class="std">
            <b>What to do last</b>
          </p>
          <p class="std">
            The last step is (of course) the deployment in the application
            server. In the case of JBoss, simply copy the jar file into
            the deploy directory of your JBoss installation.
          </p>

    <news name="XMI" href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/xmi.htm">
      <p>
        XMI, or <b>XML Metadata Interchange</b>, is a specification enabling easy
        interchange of metadata between modeling tools (based on the OMG-UML)
        and metadata repositories (OMG-MOF based) in distributed
        heterogeneous environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of CASE tools write their models into this XML-based
        format so that other tools (like AndroMDA) can read and understand
        the model.
      </p>
      <p>
        XMI is not used consistently - it has <i>dialects</i>. We are working
        to support as many CASE tools as possible.

    <news name="Poseidon" href="http://www.gentleware.com/">
      <p>
        Poseidon for UML is a very nice UML CASE tool. It evolved
        from the Open Source project ArgoUML and enhanced Argo's
        quality to make it usable in every day modeling work.
        It is delivered in different editions to meet different
        needs of different users. There is a <b>community edition</b>
        which is free of charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The native data format of Poseidon
        is XMI which makes it an ideal candidate for use with
        AndroMDA.

        TogetherJ is another CASE tool, a really big one.
        It aims to be a complete model-build-deploy platform
        with everything in it that you would expect from
        a modeling tool packed with an IDE.
      </p>
      <p>
        TogetherJ's XMI dialect is not supported in the
        alpha version of AndroMDA. We plan to support it.
