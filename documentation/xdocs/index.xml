                Did you ever think: "mmm... all this J2EE stuff is too complex! There must
                be an easier way to program?" Read the good news: AndroMDA is here to help!
                Generating J2EE components (among others) quickly and reliably
                from models drawn in the graphical Unified Modeling Language is one of the
                primary features of AndroMDA.

                AndroMDA (pronounced: andromeda) is an open source code generation framework
                that follows the
                <a href="http://www.omg.org/mda">Model Driven Architecture</a>
                (MDA) paradigm. It takes model(s) from CASE-tool(s) and generates
                fully deployable applications and other components.

                If you're interested in learning a little bit about the history of AndroMDA, read an

                This is a <strong>*very*</strong> simplistic representation of what AndroMDA can do for you:
