        <section name="Supporting AndroMDA development">
            <p>
                As an open-source project the AndroMDA development is driven by people from all over the world
                spending their free-time adding features, fixing bugs and helping people out on the mailing lists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the infrastructure, such as CVS, the releases and the mailing lists are hosted by
                <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a>, which is free for open-source
                development. Our <a href="http://jira.andromda.org/">JIRA issue tracker</a> and our
                <a href="http://confluence.andromda.org/">Confluence wiki</a> are hosted on a different
                server, mostly for reasons of performance and configurability, our distributions are also built
                using that machine, and published more than once daily.
            </p>
            <p>
                These hosting services are not free, and we are paying for them out of our own pockets. For this reason
                we have enabled the <em>donations</em> link on the
                <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/andromda/">SourceForget project page</a>, users can
                contribute a little bit and thereby helping us out financially, contributions range from $5 to $250,
                and can be transferred using <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, if you like this project and you would like to support it then just click the link below, it will
                open in a new window.
