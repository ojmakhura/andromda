                Understanding new tools and technologies can be a daunting task. AndroMDA is no
                exception. This tutorial serves as a gentle introduction to the power of AndroMDA.
                We will show you step-by-step how to set up your development environment and build
                your first .Net application. Instead of mechanically going through a series of steps,
                we will focus on ideas and concepts. Armed with this knowledge you will be ready
                to take on real world challenges. Please set aside half a day of quality uninterrupted
                time to learn AndroMDA as there is lot to learn. Then brew a good cup of coffee
                and immerse yourself in the wonderful world of Model Driven Architecture.

        <section name="What is AndroMDA?">

            <p>
                AndroMDA (pronounced "Andromeda") is an extensible generator framework that adheres
                to the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) paradigm. It transforms UML models into deployable
                components for your favorite platform. While AndroMDA ships with cartridges that
                can generate code for several platforms and technologies, this tutorial will focus
                on generating a Microsoft .Net 2.0 application.

            <p>
                The paragraph above might have sounded like a lot of acronyms and marketing speak,
                but using AndroMDA means one main thing:<b>write less code</b>. Not only that,
                AndroMDA also lets you
                <b>create better applications</b>
                and maintain better order
                on large projects. By generating as much code as possible it helps you enforce best
                practices as well letting developers focus on higher level problems instead of spending
                time on repetitive plumbing code. Additionally, AndroMDA can generate
                <b>highly customized
                    enterprise quality code
                </b>
                to meet your project's specific needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                During development of large applications most architects and developers already
                create class diagrams and data diagrams. Typically these diagrams are made in tools
                like Visio, and the resulting artifacts are static pictures. When code changes,
                the diagrams must be updated. With AdnroMDA, these diagrams become a living part
                of your application. They are used to generate large portions of your application,
                and hence always reflect the current state of the system. When you need to modify
                your application, you change the model first, regenerate the code, and then add
                or update custom code as necessary. You get a production quality application out
                of assets that you had to create anyway.
            </p>

            <p>
                AndroMDA provides several cartridges out-of-the-box. For example, the NHibernate
                and NSpring cartridges generate robust service and data layers for your application.
                In addition, database schema can be exported to script files, allowing the creation
                of your application's database. There is also an easy way to map your model to an
                existing schema if your database has already been defined. If you wish to generate
                custom artifacts from your model you can write a custom cartridge to accomplish
                this.

        <section name="When to use AndroMDA?">

            <p>
                AndroMDA is an extremely useful tool, but you should know when to use it.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="AndroMDA is a great choice when">
            <ul>
                <li>You are starting a new project</li>
                <li>You want to save time by generating as much code as possible</li>
                <li>You are building an application that stores its data in a database</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section name="AndroMDA might not be the best choice if">
            <ul>
                <li>Your applicaiton uses an existing database that cannot be easily mapped to an object
                    model (for example, it does not use primary keys and object relationships are not
                    clear)
                </li>
                <li>You already have a mature application with existing business objects and the incremental
                    effort to model existing components is too high to provide enough value
                </li>
            </ul>

                Now that you understand what AndroMDA is and when you should use it, let's review
                some foundational concepts that form the basis of modern enterprise applications.
                After reviewing these concepts we will discuss how AndroMDA implements them in the
                applications it generates. Click <a href="application-architecture.html">here</a> to explore this topic.
