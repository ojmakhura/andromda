            <p>
                This page provides directions to create the
                <tt>UserVO</tt>
                using ArgoUML.
                The model is shown below for your reference.
            </p>

            <div align="center">
                <img src="images/UserVO.png" alt="UserVO"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                <img src="images/VoPackage.png" alt="Containment Tree"/>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will create
                <tt>UserVO</tt>
                and
                <tt>UserVO[]</tt>
                in a package named
                <tt>org.andromda.timetracker.vo</tt>. When finished, the containment tree in
                ArgoUML will look like the screen shot on the right.
            </p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
                <li>Start ArgoUML.</li>
                <li>Select FileOpen Project... and traverse to the location that you where you
                    saved the AndroMDA profile. (If you didn't save the profile locally yet, get it
                    now from<a
                               href="http://argouml.tigris.org/source/browse/*checkout*/argouml/trunk/src/model-mdr/src/org/argouml/model/mdr/profiles/andromda-profile-32-noextensions.xmi">
                        this link</a>.) Click Open to open this model and then choose
                    FileSave As... and save in the newly created AndroMDA project at
                    C:/timetracker/mda/src/main/uml/timetracker.zargo
                </li>
                <li>It is critical to also update the root pom.xml to reference the proper model,
                    more specifically you will need to make the
                    <tt>model.uri</tt>
                    element point to
                    jar:file:${project.basedir}/src/main/uml/timetracker.zargo!/timetracker.xmi;
                    you will need to do this because the default value points to a plain XMI file instead
                    of the XMI file contained in a ZIP archive (the .zargo file saved by ArgoUML)
                </li>
                <li>The TimeTracker model will now open showing the only class diagram present in this
                    model. The title of this diagram is &quot;DataTypes&quot;. This diagram contains
                    platform independent datatypes that should be used in your UML model.
                </li>
                <li>In the Containment Tree on the left, click on the root element called Data
                    to select it and change its name to &quot;TimeTracker&quot; in the property panel at the
                    bottom of the screen. .
                </li>
                <li>Now right-click on the TimeTracker model and select Add Package. A new package will
                    be created under the TimeTracker model element with no name so it is displayed
                    as (unnamed Package). Select this new package and name it
                    <tt>org.andromda.timetracker</tt>
                    using the name field of the property panel.
                    AndroMDA will map this package to a Java package with the same name.
                    Note: Make sure the package name is exactly <tt>org.andromda.timetracker</tt>,
                    with no leading or trailing spaces. We have found that some browsers introduce a
                    leading space in the package name if you copy it from this page!
                </li>
                <li>Now create a package called
                    <tt>vo</tt>
                    under <tt>org.andromda.timetracker</tt>.
                    We will create our value objects in this package. Note that AndroMDA does not require
                    this package structure. We are doing it simply to separate our value objects from
                    other type of objects such as business entities, services etc.
                </li>
                <li>In the Containment Tree on the left, right-click on the
                    <tt>vo</tt>
                    package
                    and select Create DiagramNew Class Diagram. Select the newly created diagram
                    (you may need to expand the vo package in the explorer tree to see it) and name it
                    <tt>Value Objects</tt>. You should now have a blank diagram in the main editing
                    pane.
                </li>
                <li>In the toolbar above the class diagram click on the Class tool .
                    <img src="images/ToolNewClass.png" alt="Class Tool"/>
                    Now click anywhere inside the diagram. A new class will be created. The class will
                    be automatically selected as indicated by the 4 knobs around it. (If you somehow
                    deselected the class, then select it again by clicking on it.) Now type the word
                    &quot;UserVO&quot;. This word will be entered as the name of the class.
                </li>
                <li>Let's add some documentation for the
                    <tt>UserVO</tt>
                    class. It is always a good
                    idea to document your model. Documentation added to model elements such as classes,
                    attributes and methods is carried over to the code as comments. In the property
                    panel at the bottom of the screen, click on the Documentation tab. Add the
                    following sentence in the Documentation field: &quot;This class represents
                    a value object that carries information about a TimeTracker user.&quot;
                </li>
                <li>Now add the stereotype
                    <tt>ValueObject</tt>
                    to class <tt>UserVO</tt>. To
                    do this, right-click on the class and select Apply Stereotype. In the next level menu,
                    check ValueObject. You can also do this by selecting the Stereotype tab on the
                    property panel, selecting the ValueObject stereotype in the Available Stereotypes
                    column and click the &gt;&gt; button to move it to the Applied Stereotypes
                    column. Use whichever tool is most comfortable for your style of work.
                    The
                    <tt>UserVO</tt>
                    class will now have the
                    <tt>ValueObject</tt>
                    stereotype.
                    <img src="images/ApplyStereotype.png" alt="Apply Stereotype"/>
                </li>
                <li>Let's add
                    <tt>id</tt>
                    as an attribute of <tt>UserVO</tt>. Right-click on
                    the
                    <tt>UserVO</tt>
                    class and select Insert New Attribute. A new attribute is
                    inserted with the specification &quot;+newAttr : int&quot;. Write over this specification with
                    this new one: &quot;+id : Long&quot; (be sure to delete the minus sign in front of the name).
                    Note that attributes
                    are always generated as private members of a class. However the visibilities of
                    the associated getter and setter are determined by the visibility of the attribute
                    specification. In this case we have specified public visibility (by using the plus
                    sign) and hence the getter and setter for the
                    <tt>id</tt>
                    attribute will be
                    public.
                </li>
                <li>Attributes can also be added from the property panel by using the New Attribute
                    tool.
                    <img src="images/ToolNewAttribute.png" alt="New Attribute Tool"/>
                </li>
                <li>Now add three more public attributes called <tt>username</tt>,
                    <tt>firstName</tt>
                    and
                    <tt>lastName</tt>
                    to the
                    <tt>UserVO</tt>
                    class. Make them
                    <tt>String</tt>
                    type.
                </li>
                <li>Add a new class to the diagram and name it <tt>UserVO[]</tt>.
                </li>
                <li>Make sure your class diagram matches the one shown above exactly. (It is okay if
                    your class shows an empty operation compartment. This can be hidden very easily).
                </li>
                <li>Make sure that the ArgoUML explorer pane matches the screen shot shown above.</li>
                <li>Save your
                    <tt>TimeTracker</tt>
                    model by selecting File &gt; Save Project.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Congratulations! You have now specified the
                <tt>UserVO</tt>
                value object of
                the
                <tt>TimeTracker</tt>
                application. We are now ready to generate some code.
                Please go back to the main tutorial page and continue from where you left off.
