          <p>AndroMDA 5.0-SNAPSHOT now supports the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/luna/">Eclipse 4.4 (Luna)</a> and <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/">Eclipse Papyrus 1.0</a> releases from July 2014.
           Also the <a href="http://www.nomagic.com/products/magicdraw.html">MagicDraw v18</a> release from <a href="http://www.nomagic.com/news/new-noteworthy/magicdraw-noteworthy.html">June 2014</a>. Any UML2 v2.x releases supported by any UML2 modelling tool are backwards-compatible, including Rational Software Architect (RSA) v8 and v9. We appreciate the ongoing support from both organizations.</p>

        <section name="UML2 2.x is now the default supported by 3.4">
            <p>Wednesday, 17 February 2010</p>
            <p>The default EMF UML2 repository implementation was changed from UML2 1.x to UML2 2.x, in order to support
                the most current versions of the MagicDraw and Rational tools. Due to conflicting dependencies in the
                uml libraries, both implementations could not be supported at the same time.

            <p>The site suffered a hard drive failure. The site is now partially restored. There are some missing links.
                Please bare with us while we complete the restoration of the site. The forum is now back up.
                The maven repositories are working.

        <section name="UML2 2.x and RSM 7.x support added to andromda">
            <p>Friday, 05 June 2009</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the UML2 1.x EMF dependencies are not compatible with the UML2 2.x dependencies,
                both cannot be loaded by andromda at the same time. Since the maven andromda-plugins loads and validates
                all repositories when loading, and there is no way (that I know of) to change the plugin dependencies
                dynamically, the dependencies must be changed manually before running. Any suggestions would be welcome.
                Perhaps we can deprecate UML2 1.x support when everything has been thoroughly tested.

        <section name="AndroMDA 3.3 Final is released and available for download!">
            <p>Tuesday, 22 April 2008</p>

            <p>The AndroMDA committers team is proud to announce release 3.3 of the Model Driven Architecture framework AndroMDA.
                This release primarily contains bug fixes and smaller enhancements such as:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Better support for latest versions of Maven (tested with Maven 2.0.8)</li>
                <li>Ability to read *.emx files from RSA directly without the need to convert them to *.uml2.
                    AndroMDA also checks for the IBM-specific metamodels for graphical elements in UML diagrams.
                    If it finds them on the classpath, it registers them with the EMF package factory registry.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can download the new version using Maven 2 or directly from SF.net.
                Have fun and enhance your productivity with AndroMDA!
