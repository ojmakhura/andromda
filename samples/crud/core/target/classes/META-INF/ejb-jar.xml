Just an empty place holder so that the maven-ejb-plugin will build the ejb
without having an actual ejb-jar.xml (since the model will be empty initially).

Note that running mvn clean will delete this file. If there are no EJBs modeled,
mvn install will throw an error that the ejb-jar file is missing.
